# Pool

![Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maharramoff/pool/master/screen.png)

This is not a full game, but just an imitation of ball moves in the pool table. No external libraries or icons are used. Everything is drawn using the [Graphics class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html)
